/**
 * Homework 1: Tiny Text Utility
 *
 * Build a small text utility program.
 *
 * Tasks:
 * 1. Ask the user which of these 5 options they want to choose:
 *    uppercase, lowercase, drop, trim, quit
 *    If the user selects "quit", end the program.
 * 2. Otherwise, read a string from the user and apply the action they chose.
 *    For the option "drop" you need to read an additional value.
 * 3. Print the result.
 * 4. Start again at step 1.
 *
 * For the actions these functions should be used: [String.uppercase], [String.lowercase],
 *  [String.drop], and [String.trim]
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Do not crash on invalid inputs.
 * - Decompose your solution into at least 3 functions.
 * - Use at least one when-expression.
 * - Use at least one default-parameter
 * - Store at least once a function in a variable.
 * - Use at least one function reference.
 *
 * Bonus:
 * - Print statistics after the transformation:
 *      - Length of input string.
 *      - Parity of input string.
 *      - Does it contain the word "Kotlin"?
 * - Implement more transformations.
