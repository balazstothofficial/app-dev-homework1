/**
 * # Control Flow
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - Read a [String]. If it has an even length print "Even", else print "Odd".
 * - Read an [Int] safely. If the input is not an [Int] print "Not a number",
 *   if it is 1 or 2 print "Small", if it is 3 or 4 print "Medium", else print "Big".
 * - Read a [String]. Print each character of string on a separate line using a for-loop.
 * - Read [String]s until "Kotlin" is entered. If it was wrong, print "Try again".
