/**
 * # Coroutines
 *
 * To support efficient concurrency, Kotlin uses asynchronous programming built around coroutines,
 * which let you write asynchronous code in a natural, sequential style using suspending functions.
 * Coroutines are lightweight alternatives to threads.
 * They can suspend without blocking system resources and are resource-friendly, making them better
 * suited for fine-grained concurrency.
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - Make yourself already familiar with coroutines.
 *  We will need them and cover them briefly in future lectures.
 *
 * ## Resources:
 * - [Coroutines Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html)
