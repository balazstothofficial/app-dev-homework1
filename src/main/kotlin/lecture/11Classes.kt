/**
 * # Classes
 * (Data) Classes are good way to structure your data.
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - Create a class [Person], that has a first name, a last name and an age.
 * - Use a primary constructor for [Person]
 * - Create a secondary constructor, which just takes a full name and an age.
 * - Create a public property [Person.name] that combines the first and last names.
 * - Create a member function [Person.congratulate] that prints a nice message for round birthdays.
 * - Create a static property [Person.Description] that describes the class [Person].
 * - Implement the method [Person.toString].
 * - Convert [Person] to a data class.
 *   Is [Person.toString] still necessary?
 *   What other benefits does a data class have?
 * - Create an object [People], which stores some important people.
 * - Imagine that [Person.name] takes long to compute.
 *   Use property delegation and [lazy] to make sure, that it is just computed when needed.
 * - Understand property delegation: Create your own implementation of [lazy].
 *   You don't have to care about thread safety.
 * - Create an enum [Gender] and add a public property to [Person], that uses it.
